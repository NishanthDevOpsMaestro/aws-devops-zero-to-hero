It is important to understand the terms Job and Build from the jenkins standpoint.

In Jenkins, a user creates job(s) which is typically a configuration for running autonomous tasks. A job could be a task for building/packaging software, creating artifacts, deploying artifacts, creating help files, etc. This configuration may change from time to time.

Every time you run a job, Jenkins compiles the job configuration inside the project workspace to perform the defined steps. Each run of this job is called as a build and each step is called a build step. Since the environment around the job may change from build to build, any build may Fail(or become Unstable) during a run. Thus, the term - Build.
